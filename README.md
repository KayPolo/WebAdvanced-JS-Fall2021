# WebAdvanced-JS-Fall2021
Web Advanced: JavaScript Fall 2021. Class Repository

##Course Description

Most web applications are coded in some form of JavaScript. JS is a scripting language that is continuously evolving, with a large community continually building libraries and frameworks for it.

In this course, we will learn JavaScript properly. Then, we will learn useful design patterns. Then we will pick up useful tools for making cool things better.

 

Learning Outcomes

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

Strongly understand JavaScript programing language and its applications.
Ability to leverage various types of Web APIs available to client browsers.
Understanding of different JavaScript frameworks widely use in the industry.
Clear insight on Client/Server Architecture, communication with Web Servers.
Establish an industry standard workflow for building web applications.
 

Assessable Tasks

The goal of the course is to work to the best of the students’ ability. The grades will reflect that effort. Attendance, Participation, and short assignments will serve as the way to measure student engagement with the class.



Evaluation and Final Grade Calculation

Active Participation / Attendance - 30%

Short Assignments - 20%

Midterm Project - 20%

Final Project - 30%

TOTAL - 100%

 

Attendance and Participation require contributions in class and to the course forums, the day-to-day substance of the course, including but not limited to developing ideas, defining projects, working with others in a timely and reliable way.

 

Short assignments mean that there will be several assignments throughout the semester. These will usually be taking home, in which students will need to develop a project based on the learning materials.

 

Midterm and Final Project means the collective process of developing and delivering the results of the student’s project towards the end of the semester. In parallel to short assignments, the students will develop one personal project during the semester. The Midterm will serve as a mid-point checking, where they will receive feedback. The final delivery will be a culmination of the concepts learned through the course and will be a showcase for their portfolio as well as a blueprint for their future web development endeavors.

 

 
Course Outline

The course will introduce unique features of JavaScript and explore its evolution from a browser enhancement framework into a modern web framework for building efficient and highly capable applications. The learning process will work through basic programming approaches, learning syntax, applying them on individual projects and eventually preparing a modern development workflow to formalize and automate the process of building and generating a modern web programming platform.

Each class will run through topics (as outlined below) and follow up with a quiz/assignment to be completed outside the class session. Canvas will be used on a regular basis to document the projects. All the code is going to be uploaded to GitHub. Each assignment posted in Canvas should include the link to the code, analytical documentation, references and any questions, speculations related to the project on hand. All communication and course-related discussions are going to be handled via Slack.
